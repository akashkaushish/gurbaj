                  <!-- Terms desc -->
                  <p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that identifies an individual, or from which an individual could be identified (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address, credit card number or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Blabeey service, when linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or service or categories of Site and service users, from which any personal information has been removed. For example, information that forty-seven percent of the Site's registered users identify themselves as male, is aggregate information. We collect aggregate data for several purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This Policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.</p>

In the event that we engage or partner with third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of the Site and our services ("Service Providers"), we may share personal information with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. Service Providers include network operations and service monitoring (NOC) providers, server hosting companies, customer support service providers, and analytics services.  In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. When you use these services, you would be providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information would be subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.</p>
