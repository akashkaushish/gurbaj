              <p>Snapchat is a fast and fun way to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together! You can send a photo or video Snap to friends, chronicle your day through My Story, touch base with family in Chat, immerse yourself in global events through Our Stories, and enjoy handcrafted stories from the world's top publishers on Discover.</p>
              <p>When you use these services&ndash;and any others we in the Snap Inc. corporate family roll out, whether in the Snapchat app or elsewhere&ndash;you'll share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.</p>
              <p>That's why we've written this Privacy Policy. And it's why we've tried to write it in a way that's blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.</p>
              <p>One final point before we dive in: We're happy to report that we participate in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, which you can read more about here.</p>
              <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Information you choose to give us.</li>
                <li>Information we get when you use our services.</li>
                <li>Information we get from third parties.</li>

              <h4>Information You Choose to Give Us</h4>
              <p>When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you'd like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p>
              <p>Of course, you'll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as Snaps and Chats to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send Snaps, Chats, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don't send messages or share content that you wouldn't want someone to save or share.</p>
              <p>It probably goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway: When you contact Snapchat Support or communicate with us in any other way, we'll collect whatever information you volunteer.</p>

              <h4>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h4>
              <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you've used and how you've used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps to friends. Here's a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services :</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Usage Information.</li>
                <p>We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:</p>
                <p>how you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or apply to Snaps, which channels you watch on Discover, or which search queries you submit.
                  how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</p>
                <li>Content Information.</li>
                <p>We collect information about the content you provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</p>
