                                        <p>“Blabeey” (“Application”) works as a voice messaging system. You can either choose a friend you want to send a message to or create groups of friends to have group conversations with. Then you can either select from a library of categories and subcategories to generally find the message you want to relay to your friends, or you can record your personal message via the microphone of your device and send it. Your friend gets a push notification on their mobile device. To listen to the message, he/she must open the application. Only the selected friend can listen to the message. Your friend can then respond to the message in turn. Sending a message to a friend opens up a conversation, storing this and any further message between the two of you in the application. Furthermore you can send a message to more than one friend at a time. You are also able to embed messages on photos or images that can be uploaded into the application and shared with friends.  If you record a message or uploaded and send an image, you can mark the recording or image as private with limitations to viewing.</p>
